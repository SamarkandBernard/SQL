-- In this project, I will code with the PostgreSQL language. I will query the Netflix's database to get what I'm looking for

-- First, I would like to know how many movies I have in my database, without the TV shows.
SELECT COUNT (*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie'
;

-- Then, what is the date of the most recent movies/TV shows in my database ?
SELECT MAX(release_year)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
;

-- Here, I want an alphabetical list of all the movies and TV shows.
SELECT * 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title
;

-- Now, I want to join my two tables to know who is the Director of the movie named Bright Star
SELECT n_t.show_id, type, director, title, description
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" n_p
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" n_t
ON n_p.show_id = n_t.show_id
WHERE title = 'Bright Star'
;

-- And here, I want to know which movie are the oldest with their date
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 2
;
